# Optional Features {#optional-features}

Similarly to [TenancyBootstrappers]({{ $page->link('tenancy-bootstrappers') }}), `Features` are classes that provide extra functionality and can be enabled in the config. They're all disabled by default, because they're not critical to the core tenancy scaffolding.

You may enable and disable `Features` in the `tenancy.features` configuration.

# Installation {#installation}

Laravel 9.0 or higher is needed.

Require the package using composer:

```php
composer require stancl/tenancy
```

Then run the following command:

```php
php artisan tenancy:install
```

It will create:

- migrations
- a config file (`config/tenancy.php`),
- a routes file (`routes/tenant.php`),
- and a service provider file `app/Providers/TenancyServiceProvider.php`

Then add the service provider to your `bootstrap/providers.php` file:

```php
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\TenancyServiceProvider::class, // <-- here
];
```

And finally, if you want to use a different central database than the one defined by `DB_CONNECTION` in the file `.env`, name your central connection (in `config/database.php`) `central` â€” or however else you want, but make sure it's the same name as the `tenancy.central_connection` config.

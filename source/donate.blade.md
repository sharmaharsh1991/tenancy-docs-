# Donate

If this package is helping you make money, please consider donating.

The package has been actively developed since January 2019. I have spent most of August 2019 rewriting the package to add many new features for v2. And the entire May 2020 working on v3 to make the package much more flexible, support single-database tenancy, user impersonation, resource syncing between databases, database users per tenant, event-driven architecture and many more features.

Any donations will be greatly appreciated and help ensure that the package is developed and maintained in the future.
